                <h3>The main trends of the fall-winter 2020 season</h3>
                <p>It is quite obvious that designers strive for a universal wardrobe, out of seasons and clear
                    trends,<br>
                    hence floor-length sheath dresses for the evening, strict coats and suits always and everywhere.<br>
                    On the other hand, the severity was opposed by the craving for home comfort, which found expression
                    <br>
                    in patchwork, quilted "blankets", oversized cardigans and carpet prints.</p>
                <p>The fall-winter 2020 shows were not without theatricality and trends of past eras: there are
                    silhouettes<br>
                    of Marie Antoinette's dresses, embroidered frock coats, and a costume chorus at the Louis Vuitton
                    show.<br>
                    Plus endless references to religious themes - monastic silhouettes, crosses, covered heads and
                    closed faces.</p>
                <p>Demna Gvasalia showed his version of the fashion apocalypse at all, sinking the first rows of guest
                    chairs under <br>
                    the water, along which the models walked to the accompaniment of the end of the world broadcast on
                    the LED panel, <br>
                    which made his show for Balenciaga the most spectacular and memorable show of the season.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>The main trends this fall and winter include:</p>
                    <li>Bulky shoulders and sleeves</li>
                    <li>Leather clothes</li>
                    <li>Total black</li>
                    <li>Pantsuits</li>
                    <li>Sequins</li>
                    <li>Cell</li>
                    <li>Patchwork</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And now you will read more detailed information about the sensational trends.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Closed_face" class="main selection">
                <h3>Closed face</h3>
                <p>If you prefer to go out to people incognito, this trend is definitely for you. Hand in hand with the
                    fashion <br>
                    for the most closed modest dresses is the desire of designers to hide the faces of models behind
                    masks.</p>

            <div id="Modest_black_dresses_to_the_floor" class="main selection">
                <h3>Modest black dresses to the floor</h3>
                <p>Another very important theme of the entire Fashion Week season is genuine modesty. The sexy miniature
                    dresses<br>
                    were replaced by the most restrained, puritanical, with long sleeves and floor-length skirts.<br>
                    The most spectacular, in our opinion, are completely black.</p>

                <h3>Dramatic embroidered frock coats</h3>
                <p>
                    Theatricality at Fashion Weeks this time was especially in high esteem. Confirmation is the love of
                    designers <br>
                    for dramatic embroidered jackets, which are more reminiscent of stage costumes for Shakespeare's
                    tragedies.</p>

                <h3>Mens gray coats</h3>
                <p>As you know, without classics anywhere. One of the main things next winter is a strict man's gray
                    coat, which <br>
                    will definitely become your best friend for many seasons. Look for the most correct and beautiful
                    versions <br>
                    in the collections of Alberta Ferretti, Sportmax, Prada and many other brands.</p>

                <h3>Exquisite latex</h3>
                <p>Latex in the next fall-winter season will open up a new side for fashionistas. Instead of dresses
                    with <br>
                    a touch of BDSM aesthetics, we choose suits, long skirts and dresses with draperies from iridescent
                    fabric.</p>

                <h3>Strict two with a skirt</h3>
                <p>The most desirable and fashionable ensemble of the next season is a strict wool jacket with a leather
                    belt <br>
                    and a skirt below the knee with a high side slit. It is your killer tool for your most important
                    business <br>
                    negotiations. These suits can be worn both with shoes and with high boots.</p>

                    the walls of our grandparents' apartments, and we go shopping with just such references.</p>

                <p>If you are a fan of the Crown TV series, then you will definitely appreciate this trend. Instead of
                    <br>
                    the usual evening gowns, we choose outfits that are worthy of the ballrooms of kings and queens.
                    L<br>
                    ush skirts, satin and silk ribbons, embroidery and pearls - we learn to dress in the spirit of the
                    aristocracy.</p>

                <h3>Extremely long fringe</h3>
                <p>Fringe is one of the most important trends for the coming season. Moreover, the designers urge you to
                    be guided <br>
                    by the "the longer the better" attitude and choose dresses, skirts, jackets and even bags with the
                    longest fringe<br>
                    made of leather and fabric. She will make each of your bows airy and agile.</p>

                <p>Designers urge to abandon experiments with outerwear in the coming season and look for inspiration in
                    the past. <br>
                    So, almost the most cited in the collections was the classic double-breasted coat with large gold
                    buttons, <br>
                    this is what we saw at the shows of Loewe, Givenchy, JW Anderson and many other brands.</p>

                    Moreover, Nicolas Ghesquière, Virgil Abloh and Donatella Versace suggest combining windbreakers with
                    girlish dresses, <br>

                    complex art prints <br>
                    created by Julio Pomar and Gregory Crewdson, respectively, appeared in the Kenzo and Namacheko
                    collections,<br>
                    and Natasha Ramsay-Levy at Chloé invited the artist Rita Ackermann to work on the fall-winter 2020
