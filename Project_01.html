        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <p>Crust:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (128g) graham cracker crumbs (9 to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>5 1/3 tablespoons (74g) butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <p>Filling:</p>
            <li>2 cups (454g, 2 large packages) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (152g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat
                the
                oven to 350°F.
            </li>
            <li>Make the crust by stirring together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom
                than
                on the sides.
            </li>
            <li>Make the filling by mixing together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the
                eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer
                set
                at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the
                oven,
                and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.
            </li>
            <li>Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust
                with
                strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital
                thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling
                won't look entirely set in the center.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven, and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate
                it,
                covered, until you're ready to serve it.
            </li>
            <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for
                several
                days; freeze for longer storage.
            </li>
        </ol>
